This is a sample project of a game which simulates a soccer league. In particular, in this league there are 4 teams which play against each other, in a total of 6 matches. 

The result of each match is randomly decided, but different game variables can advantage one team in favour of another, for example, the team strength, the position on the leader boards, playing at home or away, the number of goal scored, etc.

The interesting part of the simulation is the match result generation. While the single game may not show as winner the strongest team, in the long run, the strongest team is always the winner. Similarly, the remaining teams will appear in the leader boards in order of their strength.
